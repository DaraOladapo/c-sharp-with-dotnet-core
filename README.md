# Getting started with C# and .NET Core

This is a beginner code sample for learning C# and .NET Core.

## Requirements

- .NET Core Core SDK
- Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio (for the first part, we will be using VS Code)

To get the .NET SDK, visit dot.net and get the latest version. After installation, verify you installation by running

    dotnet --version

On my Mac, I have .NET Core 3 SDK Installed as of when writing this. so I get.

    GWL-Mac:c-sharp-with-dotnet-core daraoladapo$ dotnet --version
    3.0.100-preview6-012264

The version number displayed may be different from what you have on your computer which is totally fine.

Run `dotnet new` and it will show you a list of available app options to build with your installed version of .NET Core
