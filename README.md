# Getting started with C# and .NET Core

This is a beginner code sample for learning C# and .NET Core.

## Requirements

- .NET Core Core SDK
- Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio (for the first and most part, we will be using VS Code)

To get the .NET SDK, visit [dot.net](https://dot.net) and get the latest version available for WIndows, Mac and Linux. After installation, verify you installation by running

    dotnet --version

On my Mac, I have .NET Core 3 SDK Installed as of when writing this. so I get. The additional software I have here for my terminal is PowerShell.

    PS /Users/daraoladapo/Projects/c-sharp-with-dotnet-core> dotnet --version
    3.1.102

The version number displayed may be different from what you have on your computer which is totally fine.

Run `dotnet new` and it will show you a list of available app options to build with your installed version of .NET Core

## Structure

The lesson files are broken down into basic chunks to grasp and progress from simple to a 'lil bit more complex lessons.

### Starting with Console

This will be the first part of this series. We will have 20 sections in this starter section.

Read section structure [here](01-TheBasics/TheBasics.md).

### Beyond the Basics

In this section, we just spend our time writing some pretty small projects using some of the things learnt in the starting with console section.

Read more about the section [here](02-BeyondTheBasics/BeyondTheBasics.md).
